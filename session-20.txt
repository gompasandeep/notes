Ansible Roles
==================
code reuse

DRY --> Don't repeat yourself

A standard structure of writing playbooks that contains tasks, variables, dependencies, files, templates, libraries. We can reuse roles.

roles/role-name

tasks --> You can keep all your tasks here, ansible automatically loads them
	main.yaml 
vars --> variables required for this role
	main.yaml
templates --> you can keep variables in the file, ansible replace the value at runtime.
	any file
files --> We can keep files in this folder
	any file names
Handlers --> notifiers when some change event is happened
defaults/         #
	main.yml      #  <-- default lower priority variables for this role
meta  --> dependencies of this role
	main.yaml
library/          # roles can also include custom modules
	
	
An exception occurred during task execution. To see the full traceback, use -vvv. The error was: If you are using a module and expect the file to exist on the remote, see the remote_src option
fatal: [backend.daws82s.online]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Could not find or access 'backend.service'\nSearched in:\n\t/home/ec2-user/expense-ansible-roles/roles/backend/files/backend.service\n\t/home/ec2-user/expense-ansible-roles/roles/backend/backend.service\n\t/home/ec2-user/expense-ansible-roles/roles/backend/tasks/files/backend.service\n\t/home/ec2-user/expense-ansible-roles/roles/backend/tasks/backend.service\n\t/home/ec2-user/expense-ansible-roles/files/backend.service\n\t/home/ec2-user/expense-ansible-roles/backend.service on the Ansible Controller.\nIf you are using a module and expect the file to exist on the remote, see the remote_src option"}


ansible handlers are notifiers. when some change event happened in one task, we can trigger other tasks through handlers

3 components -> Mysql, backend and frontend
12 microservice

deployment
===========
there will be one folder where code exist
stop the server
remove old code
download new code
restart the server

1. remove directory
2. re create directory
3. download code

main.yaml
name
hosts
become
roles:
- frontend

roles/frontend
tasks
	main.yaml --> install and service
	
	
How do you controll tasks in ansible.. few tasks should run, few tasks should not run...
