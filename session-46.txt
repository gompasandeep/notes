volumes
==========
docker containers ephemeral, once you remove container by default it removes the data too.

you can create one directory in host and map it to container. even we delete container data will not be lost, you can remount it..

we created directory, so we have to manage it...

docker volumes --> you have to create volumes with docker commands, so docker can manage, we no need to worry of creation and managing

manually running containers
===========================
1. we need to know the dependency
2. we need to make sure network creation and volume creation
3. while removing we need to remove in anti dependency order..
4. manually run docker run commands

docker-compose.yaml

mysql
backend --> trying to connect mysql, before it is completely up, so we need to delay few sec

SG vs NACL --> 
secrets stored in SSM parameter store
developed terraform modules --> 
ansible roles
I optimised dockerfiles
