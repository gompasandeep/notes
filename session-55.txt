Selectors
==============
Scheduler --> it will decide where to run your pod

nodeSelector:
	az: 1a
	
taints and tolerations
affinity and anti-affinity


Errors in K8
==============
ErrImagePull --> if node is not able to pull the image
CrashLoopBackOff --> Container is unable to start
Pending --> worker node not availalbe in that AZ, PVC is not bound to PV
ContainerCreating --> PV, PVC

taint --> paint or pollute

if can taint the node, scheduler will not schedule any pods on to that node

17.182 --> 1b
43.212 --> 1a and tainted
51.139 --> 1a
NoSchedule --> order
PreferNoSchedule --> request
NoExecute --> already few pods, 

toleration --> allow

a dedicated worker nodes are there project savings bank project, it means any other project related pods will not be scheduled here

tolerations will not 100% gaurentee thats pods will run on the tainted nodes..

situation
==========
node is tainted --> can scheduler run the pod on that node? --> no
node is tainted --> pod asks for toleration --> can scheduler run the pod --> may be(if resources are not free or scheduler decided another node) --> Running
node is tainted --> pod asks for toleration and nodeSelector --> If tainted have resources(Running) --> if tainted nodes don't have any resources(Pending)

requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution --> Schedule the pod and execute --> hard rules, labels must be availalbe while scheduling
preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution --> Soft rule --> if labels are not availalbe then consider schedule on the node..

backend --> DB --> every day bringing provisions from market

backend --> Cache --> DB --> Cache -> 10 days rice store

backend --> node-1
Cache --> node-2

traffic should come out from node-1 and enter into node-2 and then Cache pod

pod-1 --> 17.182
pod-2 --> 

Ingress Controller
===================
Classic --> Old generation
ALB --> New generation --> host based routing

netbanking.hdfcbank.com --> netbanking target groups
sms.hdfcbank.com --> sms banking target group

url path hdfcbank.com/netbanking --> netbanking

by using ingress controller, we can expose application running in K8 to outside world.

setup ingress controller
use ingress resources --> routing rules
