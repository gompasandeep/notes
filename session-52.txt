perm storage
=============
1. SAN
2. K8 Admin
3. Expense DevOps Engineer --> they get access to only expense namespace

Expense DevOps engineer send a mail to SAN with the manager approval. SAN will take their manager approval and create storage for us.

We will forward disk details to k8 admin and ask them to create PV.

1. namespace level
2. cluster level

they create PV and send the name for us..

then we will create PVC, pod to access the storage

Kid --> Mom --> Dad --> Wallet
Pod --> PVC --> PV  --> Storage

1. install drivers
2. give permissions to worker nodes
3. create volume
4. create PV, PVC and cliam through pod
5. EC2 and EBS should be in same az incase of EBS provisioning

kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver/deploy/kubernetes/overlays/stable/?ref=release-1.40"


EBS dynamic
============

Kid --> Mom --> UPI
Pod --> PVC --> SC

StorageClass --> this object is responsible dynamic provisioning. it will create external storage and PV automatically

1. install drivers
2. give permissions to worker nodes
3. create storage class

EFS --> Elastic file sharing

1. EBS should be in same AZ as in EC2, EFS can be anywhere in n/w
2. EBS is speed compare to EFS
3. EBS is used OS disk and databases, EFS can be used for file storages
4. EBS size is fixed. EFS will be scaled automatically
5. EFS is based on NFS protocol. 2049 port
6. EBS and EFS should be mounted to any instance.
7. You can have any filesystem attached to EBS, but EFS use NFS, we can't change.

EFS static
=============
1. install drivers
kubectl apply -k \
    "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-efs-csi-driver/deploy/kubernetes/overlays/stable/?ref=release-2.1"
2. give permissions
3. create EFS
4. open port no 2049 on EFS to allow traffic from EC2 worker nodes
5. create PV, PVC and POD


EFS Dynamic
=============
1. create storage class
2. install drivers
3. give permissions

StatefulSet vs Deployment
==============
1. Deployment is for stateless applications, generally frontend and backend
2. StatefulSet is for stateful applications usually databases.
3. StatefulSet will have headless service, deployment will not have headless service
4. PV, PVC are mandatory for statefulset
5. pods in statefulset create in orderly manner with static names. statefulset-0, statefulset-1
