CMD vs ENTRYPOINT
==================
1. CMD instruction can be overriden
2. You can't override ENTRYPOINT --> ping google.com ping facebook.com. If you try to override entrypoint it will not override, but it will append
3. for best results we can use CMD and ENTRYPOINT together.
4. We can mention command in ENTRYPOINT, default options/inputs can be supplied through CMD. User can always override default options.
5. Only one CMD and one ENTRYPOINT should be used in Dockerfile

USER -> set the user of container
WORKDIR --> set the working directory of container/image

ARG
------
1. ENV variables can be access at the image building and in container also
2. ARG variables are only accessed inside image build, not in container
3. ARG can be the first instruction only to provide the version for base image. It can't be useful after FROM instruction

set the ARG value to ENV variable inside Dockerfile
