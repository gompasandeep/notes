data sources
==================
data sources are used to query existing information from the provider. 
devops-practice --> ami-356dgtr4367yt --> ami id changes when new updates are posted.

data "<type>" "<name>" {
	
}

output blocks are used to print the information. It will be used in module development too.

locals
==================
locals are used to run the expressions or functions and save the results to variable

locals are used to store expressions, it can even store simple key value pairs just like variables.
variables can't store expressions. variable can't refer other variable. locals can refer other locals or variables
variables can be overriden. locals can't be overriden

state management
==================
declared/desired infra ==> .tf files. Whatever user write in tf files, that is what user wants
actual infra ==> what terraform is creating in provider

desired infra == actual infra

terraform.tfstate ==> it is a file terraform creates to know what it is created. this is actual infra created by terraform

someone changed the name of ec2 manually inside console

terraform plan or terraform apply

terraform reads state file and then compare that with actual infra using provider

if you update tf files....

terraform.tfstate --> expense-dev-backend
compared with tf files --> expense-dev-backend-changed

if you update few paramters, resources will not be created again it will just update
but few parameters if you update, we are forced to recreate resource

tfstate is very important file, we need to secure it

clone terraform repo --> terraform apply
duplicate resources or errors

in colloboration environment we must main state file remotely. locking is also important, so that we can prevent parellel executions
