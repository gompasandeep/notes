Ingress resource
=================
Ingress Controller is used to provide external access to the applications running in kubernetes. We can set the routing rules through ingress resource either path based or host based. in EKS ingress resource can create ALB, Listener, Rule and target group. Ingress is attached to service, so it fetch the pods and add them to target group

RBAC --> Role based access control
======
Authentication and Authorization

User, Role, Rolebinding

expense-trainee --> read access to expense namespace

role should be bound to user --> through rolebinding

EKS is one platform, AWS is another platform

k8 has its own RBAC, AWS has its own

AWS integrates IAM service as authentication mechanism to EKS

a user should describe EKS to connect it..

1. create IAM user and provide describeEKSCluster access
2. we need to create role and rolebinding resources

aws-auth configmap need to be configured to connect EKS and IAM

mail suresh about his config is done, he can login
