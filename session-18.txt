facts == variables
ansible server --> connecting node --> fetch all the node data

ansible.builtin.package --> if RHEL9 it runs dnf in the background, if ubuntu it runs apt-get

loops
=============
loop

dnf install mysql -y

dnf install git -y

functions == filters
==============
we dont have access to create functions. we can use default filters available in ansible..

filters == data manipulations

453.254.2365.213

255.255.255.255

zip --> install zip 

what if module is not available?

shell and command modules

ansible.builtin.shell vs ansible.builtin.command

shell --> it is like you are logging inside the server and executing command... We can access variables, we can use redirections, we can use pipes

command --> this is like running commands from outside, you will not get access to shell variables, redirections, pipes, etc.

simple command --> you can use command module, it is more secure. shell is for complex commands and less secure

ssh ec2-user@IP command

VAR_NAME=$()
