What happens if I enter google.com in my browser?

Application
Presentation
Session layer
Transport
Network
Data link
Physical

application
=============
application google.com --> http/https
presentation --> encryption
session --> session, cookie details

transport --> port number
destination port --? 80/443/8080 22
source port --> system randomly allocates one port to get the response --> ephemeral port
32768-> 65535

Network --> IP address
destination IP address --> DNS resolution
source IP --> server IP address (private IP)
source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, data --> packet

Datalink --> Mac address
source mac --> laptop mac address
destination mac --> router mac address
frame --> data packet and mac address

Physical --> ethernet, wifi

Modem
============
Physical --> 
Datalink --> frames. source mac, destination mac addresses will be removed --> I should send this out
Network --> checks the packet . destination IP address in not with in the network. NAT(Network address translation)
source IP address will be changed to router IP(public) address
Transport --> port number accessed

response will come back to laptop and ephemeral port

NACL --> Network access control list
====================================
Public subnet --> web ALB 443 from 0.0.0.0/0
frontend ec2 --> SG checks traffic comes from ALB or not
SG checks IP and port --> layer 4

SG --> fingerprint door lock to home
NACL --> subnet, like check infront of apartment

NACL vs SG
===============
1. SG can be attached to EC2, NACL can be attached to subnet
2. SG rules are empty when you create, there are no deny in SG. when you create NACL by default all traffic will be denied.
3. SG is stateful, NACL is stateless

443, expense-dev.daws82s.online
0.0.0.0/0, ephemeral port

public --> ALB --> 443. we should allow
return traffic on ephemeral ports should be allowed

public subnet frontend instance --> private subnet ALB
destination ip: private subnet CIDR
destination port: 80
source ports of the clients are always ephemeral

frontend is client, server is private ALB
		
10.0.0.0/16 --> local

either VPN or bastion host only access DB

Network security
application security
database security

public subnet --> private subnet
80 allow from frontend private IP address only
80 allow from VPN, bastion IP address only
