Deployment
==========
when you hit nslookup on service name, you will get ClusterIP as address

You need to attach headless service to statefulset. Why?

what is headless service? headless service will have no ClusterIP. It will be attached to statefulset

pods in statefulset will be created in orderly manner. 
deployment pods names are choosen as random. but statefulset names are unique. <statefulset-name>-0, <statefulset-name>-1

why statefulset have same names, pods preserve their identity?
nginx-0 delete, statefulset creates immidiately another pod nginx-0 and it should attach to its own storage through naming convention. persistentvolumeclaim/www-nginx-0

Deployment vs Statefulset
============================
1. Deployment is for stateless applications like frontend, backend, etc. Statefulset is for DB related applications like MySQL, ELK, Prometheus, Queue apps, etc.
2. Statefulset requires headless service and normal service to be attached. Deployment will not have stateless service
3. PV and PVC are mandatory to statefulset, they create individual storages for each pod. PV and PVC for deployment creates single storage
4. Statefulset pods will be created in orderly manner. Deployment pods will be created parellely
5. Deployment pods names are choosen random. Statefulset pods keep the same identity. like statefulset-name-0, -1, etc.

Autoscaling
=============
Vertical, Horizontal

Vertical scaling --> 2CPU, 4GB, 20GB HD --> 4CPU 8GB 100GB HD
Horizontal scaling --> create another server with 2CPU, 4GB, 20GB HD and add to LB
